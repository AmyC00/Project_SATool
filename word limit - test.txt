For as long as there have been studies carried out on various aspects of our daily lives, one crucial element has been continuously picked apart and examined with immense detail – linguistics. The way we speak and communicate with others is obviously of paramount importance, especially in an era where so much of what we do has become digitized and centralized around computers, the internet and rapidly evolving technology. However, it is also important to consider how this digital communication may be negatively impacted in the case of individuals with specific neurological or developmental disorders, also referred to as neurodivergencies. For example, when considering individuals on the autism spectrum, Burke et al. (2010) discussed the myriad of potential issues specifically associated with text-based communication, such as keeping up with commonly-used acronyms and abbreviations when messaging others, as well as the lack of general prosody and tone of voice. This has also been observed over the course of the pandemic with the widespread emphasis on remote work - Das et al. (2021) noted that neurodivergent employees have been seemingly left behind in adjusting to this radically different work environment, with little to no accommodations for their neurodivergency put in place thanks to last-minute decisions and protocols designed by their employers. As such, it is important to consider how existing studies and work carried out within the field of linguistics could be used to benefit neurodivergent individuals in these spaces, and potentially lessen or resolve some of the issues they currently experience with digital communication.
Within the scope of linguistics, there is a particular field of study that has become increasingly relevant to our communication in these aforementioned online spaces – namely, sentiment analysis. As described by Mejova (2009), the field of sentiment analysis typically involves identifying positive and negative emotions, varying opinions and tonal polarity of a given piece of text. While the overall idea of sentiment analysis alongside technology dates back to the 1970s and 1980s, it truly began to evolve and come under further investigation when machine learning was integrated into existing sentiment analysis (SA) solutions; this approach went on to form the basis of modern sentiment analysis as it exists today (Puschmann and Powell 2018).
In its current state, sentiment analysis already has a wide range of uses in technology-driven spaces, from aggregating the opinion of social media users on various societal issues (Kaur and Sharma 2020) to predicting the results of political elections (Nausheen and Begum 2018). However, thanks to the innate intricacies of the way we communicate, there are a number of existing hurdles and challenges that sentiment analysis tools must try to overcome. For example, the polarity of a piece of text – i.e. classifying its overall tone as positive or negative – is something many SA tools have struggled to demonstrate reliably; this is thanks to the mixed variety of words we may use when describing our feelings on a particular subject, like a book we read, or a TV show we watched.
